## 1 Introduction


### 1.1 Target Audience

The intended audience of this Installation Guide are X-Road Security server system administrators responsible for installing and using X-Road software. The daily operation and maintenance of the security server is covered by its User Guide \[[UG-SS](#Ref_UG-SS)\].

The document is intended for readers with a moderate knowledge of Linux server management, computer networks, and the X-Road working principles.

### 1.2 Terms and abbreviations

See X-Road terms and abbreviations documentation \[[TA-TERMS](#Ref_TERMS)\].

## 2 Installation


### 2.1 Supported Platforms

The security server runs on the following platforms:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 (RHEL7) or newer operating system on a 64-bit platform. The security server software is distributed as .rpm packages through the official X-Road repository at https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-rpm/
* Ubuntu Server 14.04 and 18.04 Long-Term Support (LTS) operating system. See [IG-SS](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Manuals/ig-ss_x-road_v6_security_server_installation_guide.md) for more information.

*Note*: If run in production environment, RHEL7 install with subscription is recommenend by Icelandic X-Road Operators


### 2.2 Reference Data

*Note*: The information in empty cells should be determined before the server’s installation, by the person performing the installation.

**Caution**: Data necessary for the functioning of the operating system is not included.

### 2.3 Network Diagram

The following network diagram is an example of a simple stand-alone Security Server setup. Attention should be paid when configuring the firewall of your Security Server, as misconfigurations (e.g. exposing port 80/tcp to the public internet) can leave your server vulnerable.

Allowing incoming connections from the Monitoring Security Server on ports 5500/tcp and 5577/tcp (reference data: 1.10) is necessary for the X-Road Center to be able to monitor the ecosystem and provide statistics and support for Members.

Caution: The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) stay outside the scope of this guide.

### 2.4 Requirements for the Security Server

Minimum recommended hardware parameters:

-   the server’s hardware (motherboard, CPU, network interface cards, storage system) must be supported by RHEL7 in general;

-   a 64-bit dual-core Intel, AMD or compatible CPU; AES instruction set support is highly recommended;

-   2 CPU;

-   4 GB RAM;

-   10 GB free disk space (OS partition), 20-40 GB free disk space (`/var` partition);

-   a 100 Mbps network interface card.

Requirements to software and settings:

-   an installed and configured RHEL7 (v7.3 or newer) x86-64 operating system;

-   if the security server is separated from other networks by a firewall and/or NAT, the necessary connections to and from the security server are allowed (**reference data: 1.4; 1.5; 1.6; 1.7**). The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) stay outside the scope of this guide;

-   if the security server has a private IP address, a corresponding NAT record must be created in the firewall (**reference data: 1.9**).
